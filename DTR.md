Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Joe Peterson, Noah Zinter

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
    Joe's Goals ==> Finish iteration 3, get to iteration 4.
    Noah's Goals ==> Have a clean project and commit history through iteration 3, figure out how to make smart AI.
    Team goals ==> Clean iteration 3, practice good driver/navigator norms, use pull requests/commits properly. We'll know we're successful by committing changes after each test & method, and using pull requests at the end of each session.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): Direct collaboration is our style for this project.
  Joe's strengths ==> Repeater, so he has experience. Patience. Enjoys collaboration.
  Noah's strengths ==> Enthusiasm, diligence, creativity.   

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
  We'll patiently collaborate with creativity to solve problems.
  We'll collaborate on searching for answers in ruby docs and other resources.


Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
  Joe's schedule restraints -> Monday night repeating commitment @10
  Noah's schedule restraints -> Tuesday night repeating commitment @6:15
  8pm code cutoff
  Schedule expectation: Weekday-> meet at 4:30, communicate if schedule conflict arises with that.
  Schedule expectation: Weekend -> (if needed, revisit) Start @10am - cutoff @3pm

  Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
    Communication channel -> Slack primarily.
    Communication timeframe -> Within 1/2hr 8-8 weekdays, same 10-3 weekends.
    Decisionmaking as a team -> Alternating tiebreaks at difficult decisions, strive for readability/cleanness as metric for code decisions.
    Mental health communication -> Responsibility of person feeling overwhelmed to communicate that, Responsibility of person hearing that to make space for it.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  Strengthen driver/navigator practice, get to iteration 4, strengthen version control practices.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
  Even driver/nav split, we expect to work together entirely for the project.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
  Commit changes after creating tests / methods. Do pull requests during each session and comment for practice.


Pomodoro Break Schedule:
  Poms by request/intuition.


Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  In person if possible, asynchronous communication about issues (on Slack) if needed/if there's discomfort in starting a live conversation.

Additional Remote Considerations:
  Allow for dodgy internet possibility.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
  GitHub
  Jamboard for problem-solving

Day 1 Agenda:
  Pom 2:15
  Work in the afternoon
